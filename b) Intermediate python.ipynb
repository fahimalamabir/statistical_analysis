    "In this course, we will explore basic principles behind using data for estimation and for assessing theories. We will analyze both categorical data and quantitative data, starting with one population techniques and expanding to handle comparisons of two populations. We will learn how to construct confidence intervals. We will also use sample data to assess whether or not a theory about the value of a parameter is consistent with the data. A major focus will be on interpreting inferential results appropriately.  \n",

    "We're going to see an introduction to some of the ideas behind decision-making and testing of theories. So, we have two bags, bag A and bag B. Both bags contain 20 vouchers with values written on them. Here's a picture of what those values are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![bag](image\\11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, bag A has a negative 1000 voucher in there. It's got some positive ones too with a total value though that would put you down to 560. Bag B on the other hand, has all positive voucher values. The total value for this bag is 1,890. The labels for the two bags are going to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I'm going to mix up the bags real well, and I'm going to keep one bag. We're going to be allowed to take some data from that bag to make a decision as to which bag we think it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can decide to keep this bag that's shown or ask for the other one. Now, the end result is whatever bag we end up taking, is the one that we either have to pay out the 560, if its bag A, or we earn over 1,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, of course, we don't want bag A. Another way you can view the information is that we have two different models for the shown bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "![null](image/12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be bag A, that's our null theory, and the alternative, the more promising one that we'd like to have, bag B is our alternative, and those two models are presented in these two frequency plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be allowed to take one observation, one voucher from the bag after it's mixed well, and decide between these two competing theories. So, how are we going to make that decision? \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-3.png](image\\13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the easy ones. If we reached in and selected a negative 1,000 voucher, we know it's bag A, and we would say, \"I don't want that bag, I want the other one, please.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-4.png](image\\14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we reached in and the voucher we pulled out is  1,000 voucher? Well, now we know it's bag B that's being shown, please give me that bag. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about the value 60? Sixty could occur in either of the two bags. But if the selected voucher value was a  60 voucher, which one would you select? Would you stay with the null and say it's bag A, or would you decide, \"I think that's bag B?\" You look at the results and you say 60, that voucher value would have a much more likely chance of becoming from bag B. Bag A only has one, bag B has many more, so we'd probably go with the alternative theory. I think the shown bag is bag B. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we go to the other end and the voucher that we select is a 10 voucher value? Now, which of the two theories would you select? Would you stay with the null and say I think it's bag A, or would you go with bag B? It could happen under bag B, but again, that would be a more likely observation under bag A, so you're going to stay with the null. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are starting to form a decision rule. We're looking at the values that are possible for our observation for our data and deciding which ones seem unusual under the null theory. Thus, more likely under the alternative which would lead us to reject that null. So, let's try a few other values. What if the voucher value was a 50, what would you decide? Would you say that would lead you to reject the null or stay with that null? Once again,  50 is more likely under bag B than bag A. So, we would probably say, \"  50, I'll think this is bag B.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "How about  20? Much more likely under bag A could happen under bag B. So, again, let's put that value is, \"Well, we'll stay with the null, we'll think this is bag A.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if it was   30 or  40? Those values equally likely under the two different competing models or theories, that might be a harder decision. But we're taking the values and deciding which ones would lead us to reject the null hypothesis and which ones would lead us to stay with that null hypothesis. Now, which values generally led us to say, \"I think it's bag B, reject the null.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Were they the larger ones or the smaller ones? Since here, the larger values are more likely under the alternative, less likely under the null, it's those larger values that are more extreme and lead us to rejecting. So, our direction of extreme is said to be to the right, to the larger values. So, let's look at a potential decision rule that we could use. Let's decide we will reject that null, think the bag is bag B and keep it, if our voucher values that we pull out is  50 or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasonable rule? We can actually evaluate how well this rule would perform even before we look at our data, because there are chances of making mistakes. We can decide its bag B, and I probably use bag A, or we might end up deciding it's bag A when it's really bag B. Those are the two mistakes we could make. \n",
    "\n",
    " ![image-5.png](image\\15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's talk a little bit about those errors. So, the first error, what if we were to reject the null, meaning we got a 50 or 60 voucher value, but really the null is true? Where on our two graphs does that happen, that we are looking at rejecting the null when the null is true? Well, if the null is true, it's bag A, so look at that distribution. Where are the parts that would lead us to reject the null? Well, they would be that 50 or 60 voucher values. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-6.png](image\\16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's only two possibilities out of the 20 for which we would end up making the wrong decision, rejecting the null when the null was really true. Two out of 20, which is 10 percent, not too bad. Now, of course, there's the other mistake that could be made. The other error would be that you decide to stay with that null not rejected, but the alternative was really true, it was a really bag B. Where on our two pictures, does that type of outcome occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For failing to reject, not rejecting the null but the alternative is true. Alternative true means look at bag B and find the part which would lead you to not rejecting. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-7.png](image\\17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that's going to be all of these values here, 6 (red) out of 20 is the rate for which that error might be made. If the alternative is really true, we'd make mistake using this rule, six out of 20, 30 percent of the time. So, these two mistakes that could be made in decision-making have names.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're called a **type one and type two error**. The probabilities of those errors happening also have rotation. A type one error probability is denoted by Alpha, which is also called the **significance level**. Then, the chance of a type two error happening is Beta. So, Alpha and Beta, we can see there's a little bit of play here.  \n",
    "Often, rather than stating the decision in terms of the values of the actual response and having to consider that for every different background, we instead take a look at picking the elf that we'd like to have right up front, that probability of a type one error being set, and then we look at our data and calculate a probability from it, that probably being the **p-value**. \n",
