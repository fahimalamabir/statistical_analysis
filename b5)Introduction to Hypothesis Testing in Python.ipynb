    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a critical tool in determing what the value of a parameter could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of testing has two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis: $H_0$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a$**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests we have discussed in lecture are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One Population Proportion\n",
    "* Difference in Population Proportions\n",
    "* One Population Mean\n",
    "* Difference in Population Means\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Test for a Population Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question, we were given the background information of in previous years 52 percent of parents believed that electronics and social media was the cause of their teenagers lack of sleep. Do more parents today believe that their teenagers lack of sleep is caused due to electronics and social media?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with this background, we first want to define what our parameter of interest is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population** -parents with a teenager and that's ages 13 to 18,\n",
    "**parameter of interest** - p or population proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Test for a significant increase in the proportion of parents with a teenager who believe that electronics and social media is the cause for lack of sleep. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*With any hypotheses test, you first want to start with your hypothesis, so you make these before you even collect any data and so that's to say you not influenced in what you believe.*\n",
    "\n",
    "First hypothesis or Null Hypothesis $$H_0: p = 0.52$$\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis $$H_a: p ? 0.52$$\n",
    "'?' stands for >,< or = sign. Since we are focusing on significant increase, so in this case,\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis $$H_a: p > 0.52$$\n",
    "where, p is the population proportion of parents with a teenager who believe that electronics and social media is the cause of their teen's lack of sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we want to set a $$\\alpha \\text{( or significant level)}=0.05 $$ A significance level which typically this is 0.05. This is basically the cut-off point of when we've found something to be significant.\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will introduce some functions that are extremely useful when calculating a t-statistic and p-value for a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Survey Result:\n",
    "A random sample of 1,018 parents with the teenager was taken and 56% said they believe electronics and social media was the cause of their teenager's lack of sleep.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For further studies, we need some assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First assumption: we need to check is we need a random sample of parents.\n",
    "Second: if our sample size is large enough and that ensures that we have our sample proportions being a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How we check a large enough sample size?\n",
    "That is, $$ n.p ~\\text{be at least} ~10$$\n",
    "$$ n.(1-p) ~\\text{be at least}~ 10$$\n",
    "So, it's like were there at least 10 people that said yes, and were there at least 10 people that said no to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we don't know what p is exactly. So, instead of using p,we're going to use a pseudo p, which is $p_0$ that is the null population proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, $$ n.p ~\\text{be at least} ~10 \\rightarrow n.p_0$$\n",
    "$$ n.(1-p) ~\\text{be at least} ~10 \\rightarrow n.(1-p_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis, we believe our population proportion to be this, which for our case is 0.52 and our n again was 1,018. \n",
    "So, $$ n.p_0 = 1018(0.52)= 529 $$\n",
    "$$ n.(1-p_0) = 1018(1-0.52) = 489$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, we've set up our hypotheses, we've checked our assumptions, and now we can go on to actually running the tests and seeing if we have significant results or not.We're going to calculate a test statistic, which a test statistic that is determined by taking our best estimate, subtracting the hypothesized estimate, and dividing by the standard error of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly review the following ways to calculate a test statistic for the tests listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{Best\\ Estimate - Hypothesized\\ Estimate}{Standard\\ Error\\ of\\ Estimate}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where, \n",
    "$$Standard\\ Error \\ for\\ Population\\ Proportion (\\ Or \\ Estimate)= \\sqrt{\\frac{Population\\ Proportion * (1 - Population\\ Proportion)}{Number\\ Of\\ Observations}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the examples from our lectures and use python functions to streamline our tests."

Now, that again means that we don't have evidence against equal population proportions. So, our null hypothesis was that we have equal population proportions, and we don't have evidence against it. It doesn't mean that it's necessarily not the null hypothesis, you just don't have evidence against it. Formally, based on our sample and our p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
